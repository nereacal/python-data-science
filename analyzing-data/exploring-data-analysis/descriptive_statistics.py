################################ Describe
df.describe()

# The default setting of "describe" skips variables of type object. We can apply the method "describe" on the variables of type 'object' as follows:
df.describe(include=['object'])

################################ Value counts
df['drive-wheels'].value_counts()
# Convert the series to a dataframe
df['drive-wheels'].value_counts().to_frame()

# repeat the above steps but save the results to the dataframe "drive_wheels_counts" and rename the column 'drive-wheels' to 'value_counts'.
drive_wheels_counts = df['drive-wheels'].value_counts().to_frame()
drive_wheels_counts.rename(columns={'drive-wheels': 'value_counts'}, inplace=True)
drive_wheels_counts

# Rename the index to 'drive-wheels'
drive_wheels_counts.index.name = 'drive-wheels'
drive_wheels_counts

# We can repeat the above process for the variable 'engine-location'.
engine_loc_counts = df['engine-location'].value_counts().to_frame()
engine_loc_counts.rename(columns={'engine-location': 'value_counts'}, inplace=True)
engine_loc_counts.index.name = 'engine-location'
engine_loc_counts.head(10)

# After examining the value counts of the engine location, we see that engine location would not be a good predictor variable for the price. This is because we only have three cars with a rear engine and 198 with an engine in the front, so this result is skewed. Thus, we are not able to draw any conclusions about the engine location.
