# When visualizing individual variables, it is important to first understand what type of variable you are dealing with. This will help us find the right visualization method for that variable.
print(df.dtypes)

# What is the data type of the column "peak-rpm"?
df['peak-rpm'].dtypes

# Find the correlation between the following columns: bore, stroke, compression-ratio, and horsepower.
df[['bore', 'stroke', 'compression-ratio', 'horsepower']].corr()

# Continuous numerical variables are variables that may contain any value within some range. They can be of type "int64" or "float64". A great way to visualize these variables is by using scatterplots with fitted lines.
# In order to start understanding the (linear) relationship between an individual variable and the price, we can use "regplot" which plots the scatterplot plus the fitted regression line for the data.
# Positive linear relationship:
sns.regplot(x="engine-size", y="price", data=df)
plt.ylim(0,)
# We can examine the correlation between 'engine-size' and 'price' and see that it's approximately 0.87.
df[["engine-size", "price"]].corr()
# Highway mpg is a potential predictor variable of price. Let's find the scatterplot of "highway-mpg" and "price".
# As highway-mpg goes up, the price goes down: this indicates an inverse/negative relationship between these two variables. Highway mpg could potentially be a predictor of price.
# We can examine the correlation between 'highway-mpg' and 'price' and see it's approximately -0.704.
df[['highway-mpg', 'price']].corr()



# Weak linear relationship:
sns.regplot(x="peak-rpm", y="price", data=df)
# Peak rpm does not seem like a good predictor of the price at all since the regression line is close to horizontal. Also, the data points are very scattered and far from the fitted line, showing lots of variability. Therefore, it's not a reliable variable.
# We can examine the correlation between 'peak-rpm' and 'price' and see it's approximately -0.101616.
df[['peak-rpm','price']].corr()

# Find the correlation between x="stroke" and y="price".
df[["stroke","price"]].corr()

# Given the correlation results between "price" and "stroke", do you expect a linear relationship?
sns.regplot(x="stroke", y="price", data=df)
#There is a weak correlation between the variable 'stroke' and 'price.' as such regression will not work well. We can see this using "regplot" to demonstrate this.


# These are variables that describe a 'characteristic' of a data unit, and are selected from a small group of categories. The categorical variables can have the type "object" or "int64". A good way to visualize categorical variables is by using boxplots.
# Let's look at the relationship between "body-style" and "price".
sns.boxplot(x="body-style", y="price", data=df)
# We see that the distributions of price between the different body-style categories have a significant overlap, so body-style would not be a good predictor of price. Let's examine engine "engine-location" and "price":
sns.boxplot(x="engine-location", y="price", data=df)
# Here we see that the distribution of price between these two engine-location categories, front and rear, are distinct enough to take engine-location as a potential good predictor of price.
# Let's examine "drive-wheels" and "price".
sns.boxplot(x="drive-wheels", y="price", data=df)
# Here we see that the distribution of price between the different drive-wheels categories differs. As such, drive-wheels could potentially be a predictor of price.



# Descriptive Statistical Analysis
# The describe function automatically computes basic statistics for all continuous variables. Any NaN values are automatically skipped in these statistics.
df.describe()

# The default setting of "describe" skips variables of type object. We can apply the method "describe" on the variables of type 'object' as follows:
df.describe(include=['object'])



# Value Counts
# Value counts is a good way of understanding how many units of each characteristic/variable we have. We can apply the "value_counts" method on the column "drive-wheels". Donâ€™t forget the method "value_counts" only works on pandas series, not pandas dataframes. As a result, we only include one bracket df['drive-wheels'], not two brackets df[['drive-wheels']].
df['drive-wheels'].value_counts()
# We can convert the series to a dataframe as follows:
df['drive-wheels'].value_counts().to_frame()

# Let's repeat the above steps but save the results to the dataframe "drive_wheels_counts" and rename the column 'drive-wheels' to 'value_counts'.
drive_wheels_counts = df['drive-wheels'].value_counts().to_frame()
drive_wheels_counts.rename(columns={'drive-wheels': 'value_counts'}, inplace=True)
drive_wheels_counts
# Now let's rename the index to 'drive-wheels':
drive_wheels_counts.index.name = 'drive-wheels'
drive_wheels_counts

# We can repeat the above process for the variable 'engine-location'.
engine_loc_counts = df['engine-location'].value_counts().to_frame()
engine_loc_counts.rename(columns={'engine-location': 'value_counts'}, inplace=True)
engine_loc_counts.index.name = 'engine-location'
engine_loc_counts.head(10)
# After examining the value counts of the engine location, we see that engine location would not be a good predictor variable for the price. This is because we only have three cars with a rear engine and 198 with an engine in the front, so this result is skewed. Thus, we are not able to draw any conclusions about the engine location.




# Basics of Grouping
# The "groupby" method groups data by different categories. The data is grouped based on one or several variables, and analysis is performed on the individual groups.
# For example, let's group by the variable "drive-wheels". We see that there are 3 different categories of drive wheels.
df['drive-wheels'].unique()

# If we want to know, on average, which type of drive wheel is most valuable, we can group "drive-wheels" and then average them.
# We can select the columns 'drive-wheels', 'body-style' and 'price', then assign it to the variable "df_group_one".
df_group_one = df[['drive-wheels','body-style','price']]
# We can then calculate the average price for each of the different categories of data.
df_group_one = df_group_one.groupby(['drive-wheels'],as_index=False).mean()
df_group_one
# From our data, it seems rear-wheel drive vehicles are, on average, the most expensive, while 4-wheel and front-wheel are approximately the same in price.

# You can also group by multiple variables. For example, let's group by both 'drive-wheels' and 'body-style'. This groups the dataframe by the unique combination of 'drive-wheels' and 'body-style'. We can store the results in the variable 'grouped_test1'.
df_gptest = df[['drive-wheels','body-style','price']]
grouped_test1 = df_gptest.groupby(['drive-wheels','body-style'],as_index=False).mean()
grouped_test1
# This grouped data is much easier to visualize when it is made into a pivot table. A pivot table is like an Excel spreadsheet, with one variable along the column and another along the row. We can convert the dataframe to a pivot table using the method "pivot" to create a pivot table from the groups.
# In this case, we will leave the drive-wheels variable as the rows of the table, and pivot body-style to become the columns of the table:
grouped_pivot = grouped_test1.pivot(index='drive-wheels',columns='body-style')
grouped_pivot
# Often, we won't have data for some of the pivot cells. We can fill these missing cells with the value 0, but any other value could potentially be used as well. It should be mentioned that missing data is quite a complex subject and is an entire course on its own.
grouped_pivot = grouped_pivot.fillna(0) #fill missing values with 0
grouped_pivot

# Use the "groupby" function to find the average "price" of each car based on "body-style".
df_gptest2 = df[['body-style','price']]
grouped_test_bodystyle = df_gptest2.groupby(['body-style'],as_index= False).mean()
grouped_test_bodystyle

# Let's use a heat map to visualize the relationship between Body Style vs Price.
plt.pcolor(grouped_pivot, cmap='RdBu')
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
# The heatmap plots the target variable (price) proportional to colour with respect to the variables 'drive-wheel' and 'body-style' on the vertical and horizontal axis, respectively. This allows us to visualize how the price is related to 'drive-wheel' and 'body-style'.

# The default labels convey no useful information to us. Let's change that:
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
im = ax.pcolor(grouped_pivot, cmap='RdBu')

#label names
row_labels = grouped_pivot.columns.levels[1]
col_labels = grouped_pivot.index

#move ticks and labels to the center
ax.set_xticks(np.arange(grouped_pivot.shape[1]) + 0.5, minor=False)
ax.set_yticks(np.arange(grouped_pivot.shape[0]) + 0.5, minor=False)

#insert labels
ax.set_xticklabels(row_labels, minor=False)
ax.set_yticklabels(col_labels, minor=False)

#rotate label if too long
plt.xticks(rotation=90)

fig.colorbar(im)
plt.show()
# Visualization is very important in data science, and Python visualization packages provide great freedom. We will go more in-depth in a separate Python visualizations course.
# The main question we want to answer in this module is, "What are the main characteristics which have the most impact on the car price?".
# To get a better measure of the important characteristics, we look at the correlation of these variables with the car price. In other words: how is the car price dependent on this variable?




# Correlation and Causation
# Correlation: a measure of the extent of interdependence between variables.
# Causation: the relationship between cause and effect between two variables.
# It is important to know the difference between these two. Correlation does not imply causation. Determining correlation is much simpler the determining causation as causation may require independent experimentation.
# Pearson Correlation is the default method of the function "corr". Like before, we can calculate the Pearson Correlation of the of the 'int64' or 'float64' variables.
df.corr()
# What is this P-value? The P-value is the probability value that the correlation between these two variables is statistically significant. Normally, we choose a significance level of 0.05, which means that we are 95% confident that the correlation between the variables is significant.

# Let's calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and P-value of 'wheel-base' and 'price'.
pearson_coef, p_value = stats.pearsonr(df['wheel-base'], df['price'])
print("The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is", pearson_coef, " with a P-value of P =", p_value)  
# Since the p-value is < 0.001, the correlation between wheel-base and price is statistically significant, although the linear relationship isn't extremely strong (~0.585).

# Let's calculate the  Pearson Correlation Coefficient and P-value of 'length' and 'price'.
pearson_coef, p_value = stats.pearsonr(df['length'], df['price'])
print("The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is", pearson_coef, " with a P-value of P = ", p_value)  
# Since the p-value is < 0.001, the correlation between length and price is statistically significant, and the linear relationship is moderately strong (~0.691).

# Let's calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and P-value of 'width' and 'price':
pearson_coef, p_value = stats.pearsonr(df['width'], df['price'])
print("The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is", pearson_coef, " with a P-value of P =", p_value ) 
# Since the p-value is < 0.001, the correlation between width and price is statistically significant, and the linear relationship is quite strong (~0.751).

# Let's calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and P-value of 'curb-weight' and 'price':
pearson_coef, p_value = stats.pearsonr(df['curb-weight'], df['price'])
print( "The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is", pearson_coef, " with a P-value of P = ", p_value)  
# Since the p-value is < 0.001, the correlation between curb-weight and price is statistically significant, and the linear relationship is quite strong (~0.834).

# Let's calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and P-value of 'engine-size' and 'price':
pearson_coef, p_value = stats.pearsonr(df['engine-size'], df['price'])
print("The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is", pearson_coef, " with a P-value of P =", p_value)
# Since the p-value is < 0.001, the correlation between engine-size and price is statistically significant, and the linear relationship is very strong (~0.872).

# Let's calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and P-value of 'bore' and 'price':
pearson_coef, p_value = stats.pearsonr(df['bore'], df['price'])
print("The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is", pearson_coef, " with a P-value of P =  ", p_value ) 
# Since the p-value is < 0.001, the correlation between bore and price is statistically significant, but the linear relationship is only moderate (~0.521).

# We can relate the process for each 'city-mpg' and 'highway-mpg':
pearson_coef, p_value = stats.pearsonr(df['city-mpg'], df['price'])
print("The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is", pearson_coef, " with a P-value of P = ", p_value) 
# Since the p-value is < 0.001, the correlation between city-mpg and price is statistically significant, and the coefficient of about -0.687 shows that the relationship is negative and moderately strong.

# Highway-mpg vs. Price
pearson_coef, p_value = stats.pearsonr(df['highway-mpg'], df['price'])
print( "The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is", pearson_coef, " with a P-value of P = ", p_value )
# Since the p-value is < 0.001, the correlation between highway-mpg and price is statistically significant, and the coefficient of about -0.705 shows that the relationship is negative and moderately strong.



# ANOVA
# Since ANOVA analyzes the difference between different groups of the same variable, the groupby function will come in handy. Because the ANOVA algorithm averages the data automatically, we do not need to take the average before hand.
# To see if different types of 'drive-wheels' impact 'price', we group the data.
grouped_test2=df_gptest[['drive-wheels', 'price']].groupby(['drive-wheels'])
grouped_test2.head(2)
df_gptest
# We can obtain the values of the method group using the method "get_group".
grouped_test2.get_group('4wd')['price']
# We can use the function 'f_oneway' in the module 'stats' to obtain the F-test score and P-value.
f_val, p_val = stats.f_oneway(grouped_test2.get_group('fwd')['price'], grouped_test2.get_group('rwd')['price'], grouped_test2.get_group('4wd')['price'])  
print( "ANOVA results: F=", f_val, ", P =", p_val) 

# This is a great result with a large F-test score showing a strong correlation and a P-value of almost 0 implying almost certain statistical significance. But does this mean all three tested groups are all this highly correlated?
# fwd and rwd
f_val, p_val = stats.f_oneway(grouped_test2.get_group('fwd')['price'], grouped_test2.get_group('rwd')['price'])  
print( "ANOVA results: F=", f_val, ", P =", p_val )
# 4wd and rwd
f_val, p_val = stats.f_oneway(grouped_test2.get_group('4wd')['price'], grouped_test2.get_group('rwd')['price'])  
print( "ANOVA results: F=", f_val, ", P =", p_val)
# 4wd and fwd
f_val, p_val = stats.f_oneway(grouped_test2.get_group('4wd')['price'], grouped_test2.get_group('fwd')['price'])  
print("ANOVA results: F=", f_val, ", P =", p_val)

# We now have a better idea of what our data looks like and which variables are important to take into account when predicting the car price. We have narrowed it down to the following variables:
# 'Drive-Wheels' is the only categorical variable. The rest are all Continuous numerical variables.

# As we now move into building machine learning models to automate our analysis, feeding the model with variables that meaningfully affect our target variable will improve our model's prediction performance.
