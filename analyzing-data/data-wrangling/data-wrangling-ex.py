# Standarization: Standardization is the process of transforming data into a common format, allowing the researcher to make the meaningful comparison.

# Normalization: Normalization is the process of transforming values of several variables into a similar range. Typical normalizations include scaling the variable so the variable average is 0, scaling the variable so the variance is 1, or scaling the variable so the variable values range from 0 to 1.
# To demonstrate normalization, let's say we want to scale the columns "length", "width" and "height".
# replace (original value) by (original value)/(maximum value)

# Binning: Binning is a process of transforming continuous numerical variables into discrete categorical 'bins' for grouped analysis.
# In our dataset, "horsepower" is a real valued variable ranging from 48 to 288 and it has 59 unique values. What if we only care about the price difference between cars with high horsepower, medium horsepower, and little horsepower (3 types)? Can we rearrange them into three â€˜bins' to simplify analysis?

# Indicator variable: An indicator variable (or dummy variable) is a numerical variable used to label categories. They are called 'dummies' because the numbers themselves don't have inherent meaning.
# We use indicator variables so we can use categorical variables for regression analysis in the later modules.
# We see the column "fuel-type" has two unique values: "gas" or "diesel". Regression doesn't understand words, only numbers. To use this attribute in regression analysis, we convert "fuel-type" to indicator variables.
# We will use pandas' method 'get_dummies' to assign numerical values to different categories of fuel type.
